# Wordle Solver

https://zacbutko.github.io/wordle-solver/ 

Hi there! I created this wordle solver to combat the rise wordle games. It gives you ideas for when you just can't think of a possible solution, and gives some strategy by helping to eliminate letters left in possible solutions.

## Currenty strategies:

1. Try one of the possible solutions matching all patterns you've received so far
2. High entropy. Choose a word which eliminates the most number of characters of remaining options

The algorighms aren't done yet! There are many more strategies to explore. So far this is just a web framework for playing the game.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute a strategy, tests, or code cleanups, you're welcome to it! Please make a PR :)

Thanks,
Zac
